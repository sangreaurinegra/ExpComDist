  abstract     = {The rapid technological advances in the Internet of Things ({IoT}) allows the blueprint of Smart Cities to become feasible by integrating heterogeneous cloud/fog/edge computing paradigms to collaboratively provide variant smart services in our cities and communities. Thanks to attractive features like ﬁne granularity and loose coupling, the microservices architecture has been proposed to provide scalable and extensible services in large scale distributed {IoT} systems. Recent studies have evaluated and analyzed the performance interference between microservices based on scenarios on the cloud computing environment. However, they are not holistic for {IoT} applications given the restriction of the edge device like computation consumption and network capacity. This paper investigates multiple microservice deployment policies on edge computing platform. The microservices are developed as docker containers, and comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the performance and interference of microservices running on benchmark scenarios.},

  abstract   = {We offer a specialized toolkit for automating both knowledge management when creating an applied microservices package and data accumulating during its application for scientific computations in a hybrid computing environment. The decentralized solving of the declaratively formulated problem is carried out by an active agent group. This group is selforganized by logical inference on the distributed knowledge base of a subject domain. The developed toolkit automates the creating and updating of the local knowledge base of the manager-agent of applied microservices package, as well as the local knowledge bases of distributed computational agents. Local knowledge bases are formed using a description of the interface of computational microservices managed by these agents. Microservice ensembles, corresponding to the active group, are stored in the knowledge base of the manager-agent. The developed toolkit uses this information for testing microservice in the case of its update. In hybrid computing, this toolkit provides synchronizing, archiving, and saving of calculated data. Hybrid infrastructure combines the reliability and availability of using on-premises computers with scaling to the cloud when peak loads occur. The conducted experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the presented approach for solving practically significant scientific problems.},
